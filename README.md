## Building

`sf4e` is built primarily with [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)
2019 16.10 or later with Visual C++. Other development environments will need
support for installing dependencies, ideally via [vcpkg](https://vcpkg.io/en/index.html)
and build file generation via [CMake](https://cmake.org/).

To build sf4e with VS2019 16.10+:

1. Follow steps 1 and 2 in [`vcpkg`'s Getting Started guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/vcpkg/get_started/get-started),
   stopping after `vcpkg` has been bootstrapped.
   - You can stop at step 3- sf4e already has a manfest file.
2. Set up a local `CMakeUserPresets.json` to describe your environment.
   The following can be used as a quickstart, making sure to provide the
   path to the copy of `vcpkg` checked out in step 1: 
```
{
    "version": 2,
    "configurePresets": [
      {
        "name": "default",
        "inherits": "x86-msvc-ninja-relwithdebinfo",
        "environment": {
          "VCPKG_ROOT": "C:/Users/myuser/path/to/vcpkg"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
  
```
   - Since SF4 is a 32-bit executable, `sf4e` and its dependencies
     (most importantly Detours) also need to be built targeting a
     32-bit host to properly hook SF4's instructions.
3. Open `CMakeLists.txt` with VS2019's native CMake integration.
   - Ensure [CMakePresets.json integration in Visual Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/cmake-presets-vs?view=msvc-170#enable-cmakepresets-json-integration) is enabled.
4. Run `Build All`. Confirm that `Launcher.exe` and `Sidecar.dll` are in
   the build output.
5. Run `Launcher.exe`.

To build sf4e with the CMake command line:

1. Set up `vcpkg`, as above in step 1.
2. Set up a local `CMakeUserPresets.json` to describe your environment,
   as above in step 2.
3. Using a CLI environment with CMake and a compiler prepared, run
   `cmake --preset default` from the root of the repository.
   - VS users may wish to use either the x86 Native Tools or the
     x64_x86 Cross Tools developer command prompts, as they already
     provide tools like Ninja and Cmake, and have the various environment
     variables used by CMake already prepared.
4. Build sf4e by running `cmake --build ./path-to-binary-dir/` from the root
   of the repository. Confirm that `Launcher.exe` and `Sidecar.dll` are in
   the build output.
   * If a `CMakeUserPresets.json` file like the one in step 2 is used, the
     the binary dir is `./msvc-build/default`.
5. Run `Launcher.exe`.

Builds generated with CMake that cannot take advantage of `vcpkg` will need to
provide the following dependencies:

* [Detours](https://github.com/microsoft/Detours). Detours is used to install
  custom netplay hooks at runtime.
* [ValveFileVDF](https://github.com/TinyTinni/ValveFileVDF). ValveFileVDF
  is used to parse Steam's configuration files, to automatically detect
  your installation of SF4.
* [Dear Imgui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui). Dear Imgui is used to
  provide custom overlays for new features and non-durable,
  development-time debugging.
* [spdlog](https://github.com/gabime/spdlog). `spdlog` is used to provide
  durable file logging, both at development time and in release builds.
* [nlohmann/json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json). `json` is used for
  message serialization.
* [GameNetworkingSockets](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/GameNetworkingSockets/).
  `GamenNetworkingSockets` provides a very helpful high-level API on top
  of message passing, and additionally supports NAT hole punching if
  a signalling server is run.
* [GGPO](https://github.com/pond3r/ggpo), used to provide rollback.
