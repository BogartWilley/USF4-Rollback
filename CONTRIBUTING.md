# How to contribute

## Testers and players: Submitting bugs

**Please do**:
* Submit issues when you find a bug! Our issue template
  has a good checklist of things to include when submitting an issue. Issue
  reports without a complete description may be rejected outright.
* Include video evidence when sending issues! Video is extremely helpful
  for both describing and reproducing issues. If you have the computing
  resources to spare, you may want to consider recording tests with
  [OBS](https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio) or another screen-recording
  solution.

**Please do not**:
* Submit feature requests. As players, we already have a lot of features in mind-
  to the point where we could work on this project as if it was a full time job.
